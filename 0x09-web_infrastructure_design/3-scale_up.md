Infrastructure Design:


Server 1 (Web Server):

Nginx is used as the web server on Server 1. It handles incoming HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.

Server 2 (Application Server):

This server hosts the application server, which executes the website's business logic, processes dynamic content requests, and communicates with the database.

Server 3 (Database Server):

MySQL is used as the database management system on Server 3. It stores and manages data for the website.

Server 4 (Load Balancer - HAProxy):

HAProxy is configured as the load balancer. It distributes incoming traffic across Server 1 and Server 2 to ensure load distribution, fault tolerance, and high availability.

Explanation of Specifics:
Web Server (Nginx):

Why: The web server handles HTTP requests, serving static content and forwarding dynamic content requests to the application server. Separating the web server from the application server enhances performance and allows for better resource utilization.
Application Server:

Why: The application server executes the website's business logic and processes dynamic content requests. Separating it from the web server ensures isolation and allows for independent scaling based on application demands.
Database Server (MySQL):

Why: The database server stores and manages data for the website. Separating the database from the application server ensures data consistency, integrity, and allows for specific security measures for database management.
Load Balancer (HAProxy):

Why: The load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed with too much load. Configuring HAProxy as a cluster with another load balancer ensures redundancy and fault tolerance, preventing a single point of failure in the load balancing layer.


Additional Considerations:
Scalability:

Each component (web server, application server, database) is hosted on a separate server, allowing for horizontal scaling. This means that if the demand for any specific component increases, you can add more servers of that type to handle the increased load.
High Availability:

By configuring HAProxy as a cluster and separating components onto different servers, the infrastructure is designed for high availability. If one server fails, the load can be distributed to others, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous service availability.
Isolation:

Separating components into different servers provides isolation. If one component fails (e.g., the application server), it doesn't necessarily impact the others (e.g., web server or database), improving fault tolerance and ease of troubleshooting.
This design considers best practices for scalability, high availability, and isolation of components, providing a robust foundation for hosting the website www.foobar.com.
