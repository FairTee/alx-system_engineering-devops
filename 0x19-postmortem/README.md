Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from March 3rd, 2024, 10:00 PM UTC to March 4th, 2024, 2:00 AM UTC.
Impact: The service experienced intermittent downtime, affecting approximately 30% of users. Users reported slow loading times and occasional errors during this period.
Root Cause: A configuration error in the load balancer settings caused improper routing of incoming requests, leading to degraded service performance.
Timeline:

March 3rd, 2024, 10:00 PM UTC: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in error rates and latency.
10:15 PM UTC: Engineering team alerted to investigate the issue.
10:30 PM UTC: Initial investigation focused on backend server health and network connectivity.
11:00 PM UTC: Misleading assumption made that the issue stemmed from database overload due to recent code deployment.
11:30 PM UTC: Incident escalated to senior engineering team for further investigation.
March 4th, 2024, 12:00 AM UTC: Load balancer configuration reviewed, identifying misconfigured routing rules.
1:00 AM UTC: Configuration corrected to restore proper routing and service functionality.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing incoming requests to be improperly routed to backend servers. This resulted in degraded service performance and intermittent downtime.

To resolve the issue, the misconfigured load balancer settings were corrected to ensure proper routing of incoming requests. Additionally, monitoring systems were enhanced to provide better visibility into load balancer configuration changes and their impact on service performance.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Implement automated configuration checks for load balancers to detect and prevent misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time alerts for abnormal load balancer behavior.
Conduct regular audits of load balancer configurations to ensure alignment with best practices and avoid future issues.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Implement automated load balancer configuration validation checks.
Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations to identify and address any additional misconfigurations.
Enhance documentation and training materials for engineering teams regarding load balancer configuration best practices.
Schedule regular review sessions to discuss recent configuration changes and their potential impact on service performance.
By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to mitigate the risk of similar incidents in the future and ensure the continued reliability and performance of our services.
